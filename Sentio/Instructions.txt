In my solution there are 3 classes for user(LoginUser, Account, ConversationAccount)

LoginUser
It keeps Id, Pass, User Name

Account
It keeps Status, Contacts and It can create new Conversation with CreateConversation

ConversationAccount
This class is detailed for keeping Account's conversation informations 
It can send new message, can see Account's specific conversation's notifications, can show message history of conversation etc

Conversations can be create from ConversationFactory class(I used Factory pattern for that), It creates suitable conversation from its type and if there is any error it sends exceptions.

When any account send any message to any conversation Notifications will be sent to all attendeed accounts.
I used Observer pattern for implementing notification part.
